Supply this tool an array of arrays, which will then be converted into a CSV file and hosted publically. The tool will then provide a publicly accessible link to download the file.\n\nYou should present the first few rows (not more then three rows) of the data in a Markdown table format to the user for review, ask if user want any changes, add/remove any columns and how many rows he want if he didn't already provided that or if you can proceed. If the user wants any changes, you can modify the data accordingly. Once the user is satisfied, then and only then send the final array of arrays to the tool.\n\nThe tool will then generate the file and provide a new download link. Remember to inform the user that the data shown in the table is only the structure and you will generate final csv file when user confirms the structure.\n\nIf the user requests further modifications to the data, you can make the changes and have the tool generate a new file.",
